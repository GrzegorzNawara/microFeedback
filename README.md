# MicroFeedback Tool

Under development

Every facilitator will agree, that there is a lot of value in an individual
attendee feedback given after a workshop.
Unfortunately running workshop does not leave you a lot of time for sharing your
personal insight. Individual feedback takes a lot of time and effort.
And too often there is simply no time to do it.

After some years of experience I have prepared an easy-to-use tool for giving
micro feedback.

MicroFeedback tool allows your to save your insight during a workshop and share
it with just one click.


Built using Redux + React + Bootstrap4
Also JSX and Saga
